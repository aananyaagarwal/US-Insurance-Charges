**Project Title: U.S. Medical Insurance Costs Prediction with Decision Tree Classification**

**Introduction:**

This project aims to predict medical insurance costs using a decision tree classification algorithm based on various categorical labels such as sex, smoker status, number of children, and region. The dataset contains information about individuals' demographic details and their corresponding medical charges.

**Data Exploration:**

The initial exploration involves plotting the relationship between age and charges, followed by identifying and handling missing values within the dataset.

**Feature Engineering:**

A new column is created to represent whether the charges are above or below the mean charges, which serves as the target variable for prediction. Categorical labels are encoded into numerical values using LabelEncoder.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**

A decision tree classifier is trained on the encoded features to predict whether the charges are above or below the mean. The model's accuracy is evaluated and plotted against different maximum depth values.

**Conclusion:**

The decision tree classification model provides insights into whether an individual's medical charges are above or below the mean based on demographic factors. The model's accuracy remains relatively consistent across different maximum depth values, indicating robust performance. Future predictions can be made using the trained model to estimate medical costs for individuals with similar characteristics.
